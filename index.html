		<h1>It's Raining Cats and Dogs—and Dog Bites</h1>
		<h3>After years of unchecked backyard breeding, the city is now banning the sale of animals in pet shops. Will this lead to a decrease in dog bites? </h3>

		<p> 	In a bid to crack down on animal mistreatment and overpopulation, the New York City Council has passed a <a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=6830039&GUID=07B81FA3-8978-4DEE-8846-3F546DDBB570&Options=&Search=." target="blank">bill prohibiting the sale of animals in pet shops.</a> 
			The ban on “backyard breeding” passed in a 40-5 vote on Nov. 21 and will forbid the harmful practice of breeding and selling animals across the five boroughs.
			<br>
			<br>

		 	says Theresa Samsingh, 59, the founder of South Jamaica-based animal organization For Animals, Inc.

			Spayed and neutered animals are <a href=" https://www.brown.edu/Research/Colwill_Lab/CBP/spaynueter.htm#:~:text=Spayed%20and%20neutered%20pets%20are%20less%20likely%20to%20bite.%20Unaltered%20animals%20often%20exhibit%20more%20behavior%20and%20temperament%20problems%20than%20those%20that%20have%20been%20spayed%20or%20neutered." target="blank">less likely to bite </a>and help prevent animal overpopulation by stopping unwanted pregnancies in animals. 
			However, dog breeders may not spay or neuter their dogs so that they can continue to breed and sell their animals.
			<br>
			<br>
			In a data analysis of dog bites reported in Brooklyn, reports climbed <span class="bold">69%</span> between 2015 and 2022. 
			This points to a potential uptick in dog breeding in Brooklyn between these years.
			<br>
			<br>
			In both years, <span class="bold">about 89%</span> of dog bites were from dogs who have not been spayed or neutered, which shows a correlation between unfixed dogs who are potentially a product of backyard breeding and amount of dog bites in the borough.</p>
